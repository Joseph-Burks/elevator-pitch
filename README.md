Joseph Burks

I have been a chef for a number of years.  I recently got engaged and decided it was time to get into something that is more condusive to starting a family.  In speaking with a few of my close friends who are in the software engineering field, I realized it is something I could be passionate about because of my affenity for problem solving.  I have just recently started programing bootcamp at Flatiron School, where we are currently learning Ruby.  I am looking forward to the journey and becoming a full stack developer.
